                    React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013. React Native, which enables native Android, iOS, and UWP development with React, was announced at Facebook's React.js Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015. On April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, a new core algorithm of React framework library for building user interfaces. React Fiber was to become the foundation of any future improvements and feature development of the React framework.

                    The smallest React example to print hello world on screen looks like this:
                </p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>ReactDOM.render(
                        <br>&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1 &gt;,
                        <br> document.getElementById( 'root' )
                        <br>);
                    </code>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;;

                    It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript. React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

            <article>
                <p>Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps. An element describes what you want to see on the screen. Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.
                </p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        &lt;div id="root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>Let’s say there is a &lt;div&gt; somewhere in your HTML file as above. We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM. Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like. To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render():
                </p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world&lt;/h1&gt;;
                        <br>ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
                    </code>

                <p>
                    Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. You can find a detailed component API reference here. Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
                </p>
                <h3>Rendering a component</h3>
                <p>
                    Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:
                </p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        const element = &lt;div /&gt;;
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    However, elements can also represent user-defined components:
                </p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        const element = &lt;Welcome name="Sara" /&gt;;
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”. For example, this code renders “Hello, Sara” on the page:
                </p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        function Welcome(props) {
                        <br> return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
                        <br> }
                        <br>
                        <br> const element = &lt;Welcome name="Sara" /&gt;;
                        <br> ReactDOM.render( element, document.getElementById('root')
                        <br>);
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>Let’s recap what happens in this example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We call ReactDOM.render() with the &lt;Welcome name="Sara" /&gt; element.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            React calls the Welcome component with {name: 'Sara'} as the props.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Our Welcome component returns a &lt;h1&gt;Hello, Sara&lt;/h1&gt; element as the result.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match &lt;h1&gt;Hello, Saralt&lt;/h1&gt;.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                    You can convert a functional component like Clock to a class in five steps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add a single empty method to it called render().
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Move the body of the function into the render() method.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Delete the remaining empty function declaration.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    React is, in our opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript. It has scaled very well for us at Facebook and Instagram. One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them. In this document, we’ll walk you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table using React.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy</h3>
                <p>
                    Our JSON API returns some data that looks like this:
                    <div class="code-container">
                        <code>
                            [ {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$49.99", stocked: true, name: "Football"},
                            <br> {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$9.99", stocked: true, name: "Baseball",
                            <br> {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$29.99", stocked: false, name: "Basketball"},
                            <br> {category: "Electronics", price: "$99.99", stocked: true, name: "iPod Touch"},
                            <br> {category: "Electronics", price: "$399.99", stocked: false, name: "iPhone 5"},
                            <br> {category: "Electronics", price: "$199.99", stocked: true, name: "Nexus 7"}
                            <br> ];
                        </code>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names. If you’re working with a designer, they may have already done this, so go talk to them! Their Photoshop layer names may end up being the names of your React components!
                </p>
                <p>
                    But how do you know what should be its own component? Just use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the single responsibility principle, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents. Since you’re often displaying a JSON data model to a user, you’ll find that if your model was built correctly, your UI (and therefore your component structure) will map nicely. That’s because UI and data models tend to adhere to the same information architecture, which means the work of separating your UI into components is often trivial. Just break it up into components that represent exactly one piece of your data model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you look at ProductTable, you’ll see that the table header (containing the “Name” and “Price” labels) isn’t its own component. This is a matter of preference, and there’s an argument to be made either way. For this example, we left it as part of ProductTable because it is part of rendering the data collection which is ProductTable’s responsibility. However, if this header grows to be complex (i.e. if we were to add affordances for sorting), it would certainly make sense to make this its own ProductTableHeader component.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 2: Build A Static Version in React</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that you have your component hierarchy, it’s time to implement your app. The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It’s best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We’ll see why. To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. props are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you’re familiar with the concept of state, don’t use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can build top-down or bottom-up. That is, you can either start with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (i.e. starting with FilterableProductTable) or with the ones lower in it (ProductRow). In simpler examples, it’s usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up and write tests as you build. At the end of this step, you’ll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. The components will only have render() methods since this is a static version of your app. The component at the top of the hierarchy (FilterableProductTable) will take your data model as a prop. If you make a change to your underlying data model and call ReactDOM.render() again, the UI will be updated. It’s easy to see how your UI is updated and where to make changes since there’s nothing complicated going on. React’s one-way data flow (also called one-way binding) keeps everything modular and fast.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State</h3>
                <p>
                    To make your UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React makes this easy with state. To build your app correctly, you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. The key here is DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself. Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand. For example, if you’re building a TODO list, just keep an array of the TODO items around; don’t keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want to render the TODO count, simply take the length of the TODO items array.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think of all of the pieces of data in our example application. We have:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The original list of products
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The search text the user has entered
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The value of the checkbox
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The filtered list of products
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>And That’s It</h3>

                    Hopefully, this gives you an idea of how to think about building components and applications with React. While it may be a little more typing than you’re used to, remember that code is read far more than it’s written, and it’s extremely easy to read this modular, explicit code. As you start to build large libraries of components, you’ll appreciate this explicitness and modularity, and with code reuse, your lines of code will start to shrink. :)
